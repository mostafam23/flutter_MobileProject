# 📱 Flutter Piscine – 42 Beirut

Welcome to my Flutter Piscine repository! This repository contains all exercises, modules, and projects completed during the Flutter Mobile Piscine at 42 Beirut. The goal of this program is to learn mobile application development using Flutter and Dart through intensive, hands-on practice.

## 🚀 About the Flutter Piscine

The Flutter Piscine is an accelerated learning program focused on building real mobile applications from scratch. Throughout the Piscine, students learn to:

* Understand Dart programming fundamentals
* Master Flutter widgets, layouts, and UI composition
* Build responsive and interactive designs
* Work with navigation, routing, and screen organization
* Consume APIs and parse JSON data
* Manage application state
* Debug and structure applications professionally
* Use Git and GitHub effectively

This repository contains all the work I completed while progressing through the Piscine.

## ▶️ How to Run Any Exercise or Project

Make sure Flutter is installed on your system: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install

### 1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the exercise or project folder

```bash
cd flutter_piscine/ex00
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 4. Run the project on Chrome

```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

Chrome is the primary environment used during the Piscine for testing Flutter applications on Linux machines.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

During this Piscine, I gained experience in:

* Building UI with Flutter widgets
* Writing clean and reusable components
* Understanding Stateful vs Stateless widgets
* Navigating between screens and structuring apps
* Fetching and displaying real-time API data
* Working with asynchronous code (`async`, `await`, `Future`)
* Debugging Flutter applications
* Structuring scalable Flutter projects
* Managing version control with Git

These skills form a strong foundation for professional mobile development using Flutter.
